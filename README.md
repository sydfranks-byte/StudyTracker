# 10,000 Hour Study Tracker
A minimalist time-tracking application inspired by the 10,000-hour mastery concept.

This tool focuses on one core function: tracking minutes spent practicing or studying a skill over time. Users log sessions, see cumulative progress, and build awareness around consistency rather than short-term productivity.

This project highlights my ability to intentionally scope software, focus on a single core metric, and implement clean, reliable logic without unnecessary complexity. By narrowing the feature set to time accumulation and progress tracking, I emphasized clarity, accuracy, and maintainable code. The tracker demonstrates disciplined problem definition, data handling, and incremental development, reinforcing a strong foundation in building software that does exactly what it claims to do.
